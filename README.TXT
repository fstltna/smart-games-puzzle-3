New Game Features List

SHEEPDOG: 

Now, in addition to TURNING the SHEEPDOG with RIGHT 
MOUSE clicks, you may also use the LEFT or RIGHT 
ARROW KEYS on the keyboard.

Plus, once you get ALL THE SHEEP on the TARGETS, 
make sure to CLICK on the SHEEPDOG if you haven't 
received all your hard-earned points and congratulations.

SYLLY BUSTER: 

At the start of each new level, remember to click RESET 
(in the lower right part of the screen) to refresh your 
collection of syllables.

TUMBLIN' DICE: 

Helpful hint: Once you've clicked on a die to select it, 
TO MOVE THE DIE you must drag the cursor within the GREEN 
playing area even if the area is covered by another die. 
If you do that, the selected die will tumble in the same 
direction that the cursor is moving in. If your cursor 
moves off the GREEN playing area, the selected die will 
not move.

WORD FLIP: 

To REVIEW your previous moves, CLICK on the UP 
and DOWN buttons on the left.
